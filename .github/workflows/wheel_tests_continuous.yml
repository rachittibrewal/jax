# CI - Wheel Tests (Continuous)
#
# This workflow builds JAX artifacts and runs CPU/CUDA tests.
#
# It orchestrates the following:
# 1. build-jaxlib-artifact: Calls the `build_artifacts.yml` workflow to build jaxlib and
#                           uploads it to a GCS bucket.
# 2. run-pytest-cpu: Calls the `pytest_cpu.yml` workflow to download the jaxlib wheel that was built
#                    in the previous step and runs CPU tests.
# 3. build-cuda-artifacts: Calls the `build_artifacts.yml` workflow to build CUDA artifacts and
#                          uploads them to a GCS bucket.
# 4. run-pytest-cuda: Calls the `pytest_cuda.yml` workflow to download the jaxlib and CUDA artifacts
#                     that were built in the previous steps and runs the CUDA tests.
# 5. run-bazel-test-cuda: Calls the `bazel_cuda_non_rbe.yml` workflow to download the jaxlib and
#                         CUDA artifacts that were built in the previous steps and runs the CUDA
#                         tests using Bazel.
